## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
The challenge that I encountered was having my version of the project not matching up with what the page instructions showed the project to look like at certain points. This was frustrating because it felt like the developer tools helped with catching a lot of the mistakes I was doing, but there would be some things that were harder to catch like missing a comma when making a multi-element selector on a line in the CSS file. Overall, I worked through these mistakes by being patient with myself and trying to review my lines of code slowly and carefully. This challenge of persistence was something that came up frequently when working with this project. For direct purposes like frustrating code errors, but there was also other things that challenged my persistence. Discouraging thoughts like not being able to finish the project even after reviewing my code or not having enough time to finish the project while juggling my schoolwork also contributed to my necessity to be persistent. However, that’s what software development is to me because it can be difficult to master even the basics when you’re a beginner programmer, and I believe with practice and effort that I can continue to improve. I hope my efforts to complete this project are worthwhile because I really would like to continue persevering through different kinds of challenges on my path to becoming a software developer.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
Most of my questions about web development are based off what working in web development is compared to learning about web development. What are the practical day to day tasks for web developers? What are the kinds of technologies web developers use on a daily bases? How much time do web developers spend on the backend compared to the frontend of their sites? How much should web developers know about databases? What are the skills all aspiring web developers should be familiar with? What are the best practices for students to become good web developers and be candidates for big job roles?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
If I had a few more hours on the project, I would want to add the features in the optional features category. Specifically, the features of making the button pattern of the game randomized and adding a ticking clock as I feel that these features would contribute the most to making the game more enjoyable and challenging. However, I’m trying my best to turn in my application now, so there is some time before the deadline for CodePath employees to review my application. I’m hoping I can improve my skills with writing Javascript and come back to improve the game after hopefully getting the internship at CodePath.
